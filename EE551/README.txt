This is a python3 script that uses the Selenium web driver to browse and pull Baseball stats from BaseballReference.com through Google Chrome
The program has two main functions: Stat Search and Stat Compare
Stat Search allows a user to retrieve stats from a single player (hitter or pitcher) just by inputting their name and a stat they want to see
Stat Compare allows a user to retreive stats from two players (hitter or pitcher) by inputting their names and a choosing a stat they want to compare
